    "Provided several CSV files that contain data on the performance of Major League Baseball(MLB) player over a span of more than a century. This historical data can be found at seanlehman.com. This project focused on writing code that compute several common batting statistics from the data in the CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The info dictionaries contain the following keys, all of which are strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "• masterfile: the name of the master CSV file that includes columns with player IDs and names.\n",
    "\n",
    "• battingfile: the name of the CSV file thet includes columns with player IDs and batting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• separator: the delimiter character used in the two CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "• quote: the quote character used in the two CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "• playerid: the name ofthe column header for player IDs in both the master and batting CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "• firstname: the name ofthe column header for player's first names in the master CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "• lastname: the name ofthe column header for players last names in the master CSV file.\n",

    "#### Part 1: Compute players with top batting statistics by year\n",
    "The task is to write four functions that can be used in combination to compute the top players based on a provided statistical formula for a given year. These functions will select a subset of the data and compute the provided statistic on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Compute players with top batting statistics by career\n",
    "The task is to wirite two more functions that can used along with the other four functions to compute the top players based on a provided statistical formula for their entre career. These functions will aggregate the yearly data in date that spans and player's career and then compute the provided statistic on this data."
