There was a crush at Mrs. Evershed’s beautiful house in Mark Place, and
she now stood at the head of the staircase receiving her guests. Her
face wore a smile, and conventional words of welcome rose to her lips.

She was a handsome woman of about forty, and there were few people, even
in Mayfair, who entertained more brilliantly. To look at her, her house,
her servants, her guests, no one would suppose that she had a care in
the world, and yet just behind that smiling face grim care dwelt.

At this very moment, while money was being as lavishly expended as if it
were mere water, she herself was on the verge of bankruptcy. The crisis
was imminent; her creditors clamored. It would be impossible to keep the
wolf at bay more than a few days longer. She knew of this, but still she
smiled and received her guests with unction.

Meanwhile Barbara, Mrs. Evershed’s only daughter, had hidden herself in
the recess of a curtained window. She was nineteen years of age, and was
considered one of the handsomest girls who had made their _debut_ that
season. Had she been worldly-minded, and only thought of money, she
might have made a match which would have saved Mrs. Evershed from all
her money liabilities forever, but this was not Barbara’s way.

She was a rebellious girl; she had never wanted for money, and could not
realize the fact that she might soon be penniless. With sparkles in her
eyes, lips slightly parted, and cheeks with the glow of beautiful
expectation on them, she waited in her corner. Now and then she peeped
forward and glanced at her mother. She knew perfectly well what her
mother’s thoughts were.
